# Evaluation-Extension
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is the code for a google extension I am working on. It is for evaluating on <a href="khanacademy.org">Khan Academy</a>. It will allow people to evaluate faster and just a whole lot of cool benefits like resources and goals. If anyone wants to help me feel free to ask me, I would love it! <strong>NOTE: This is not endorsed or created by khan academy and was made independently by community members.</strong></p>

<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>If you don't know about extensions, don't worry too much. All you need to really know is JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Javascript, you particularily need to know how to edit the DOM. Through the content.js file you can modify KA's webpage, and through the pop-up.html file you can modify a popup that comes up when you click the extension icon. To test the extension, download the file, open this up in chrome chrome://extensions/, turn on developer mode, and unpack the extension file <strong>(not evaluation-extension file)</strong>. Then you can test it and reload the extension/pages as needed.</p>

<h3>Alerts</h3>
