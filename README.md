# Evaluation-Extension

 If you don't know about extensions, don't worry too much, just know that through the content.js file you can modify KA's webpage, and through the pop-up.html file you can modify a popup that comes up when you click the extension icon. To test the extension, download the file, open this up in chrome chrome://extensions/ , turn on developer mode, and unpack the file. Then you can test it and reload the extension/pages as needed.
