# Evaluation-Extension
<h3>About</h3>
<p>This is the code for a google extension I am working on. It will allow people to evaluate faster and just a whole lot of cool benefits like resources and goals. If anyone wants to help me feel free to ask me, I would love it!</p>

<h3>How can you help?</h3>
<p>If you don't know about extensions, don't worry too much, just know that through the content.js file you can modify KA's webpage, and through the pop-up.html file you can modify a popup that comes up when you click the extension icon. To test the extension, download the file, open this up in chrome chrome://extensions/ , turn on developer mode, and unpack the file. Then you can test it and reload the extension/pages as needed. </p>
